# This folder contains the current state of the app
Separated the dummy data and the actual frontend code 

1. dummy_data.py - Contains the dummy data, this can be the way it is.

2. streamlit_frontend_only.py - This is where we can make changes in the front-end

## Steps to run

1. Download the folder

2. In any code edtor (used Visual Studio Code - can be downloaded in microsoft/app store)

3. pip install -r requirements.txt

4. streamlit run streamlit_frontend_only.py

## Notes
1. The design is exactly matched to my current design for the stylings/effects/processing when a button is clicked.
2. Login just accepts any input to the username and password for ease of access.
3. If made changes in the code just save and click rerun on the top right or refresh, but you can do rerun so you wont have to 
go back to the login page.
